## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### 👤 For Users

#### 🔑 API Credentials
- **Never share** your Telegram API credentials
- **Use strong, unique** API passwords
- **Enable 2FA** on your Telegram account
- **Regularly rotate** API keys if possible

#### 💻 Environment Security
```bash
# Set secure file permissions for .env
chmod 600 .env

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Keep dependencies updated
pip install --upgrade telegram-audio-downloader
```

#### 🐳 Docker Security
```bash
# Run as non-root user
docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) telegram-audio-downloader

# Use read-only filesystem where possible
docker run --read-only telegram-audio-downloader

# Limit container resources
docker run --memory="512m" --cpus="1.0" telegram-audio-downloader
```

### 👨‍💻 For Developers

#### 🔐 Secure Development
- **Never commit** API keys or sensitive data
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
